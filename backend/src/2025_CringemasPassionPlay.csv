Narrator,N/A,"Our action opens on Illinois Central College, that scholarly bastion of studying. It is lunchtime and the usual gang has gathered at their usual spot in the cafeteria – the “cage.” Three friends have just started their lunch and are catching up on each other’s day. First is Wee John Lad, boy genius, who has just transferred to the school from Yale Preschool. He has only recently become acquainted with his collegemates, Manos and Arnolda, a lionhearted jokester and cerebral basket case, respectively. The triad are interrupted by the approach of their fourth member, the boisterous Bulpy, sporting his signature big “B” baseball cap."
Bulpy,*Addressing the group*,Hey guys!
Arnolda,*Addressing Bulpy*,"Oh hey, Bulpy! How was Bible class?"
Bulpy,N/A,"It was great, I’m learning about the Lord! I almost have my weekly Bible verse memorized."
Manos,*Jokingly*,Sounds Scripture-licious!
Bulpy,"*First to Manos, then to Wee John Lad*","Oh, Manos! And how are things going for you, Wee John Lad?"
Wee John Lad,N/A,"By my calculations, I am nearing completion of my new serum for my serum class."
Arnolda,N/A,"Classic Wee John Lad! We didn’t have supergeniuses like you at my old school, Peoria Secular School."
Wee John Lad,N/A,"Yeah, but it can be tough sometimes being a boy genius. I’m already in community college and I’m only three years old, although I am legally required to mention I am actually thousands of years old due to my possession by an ancient dragon soul. It feels like I’ll never connect with my peers."
Narrator,N/A,"Suddenly a rowdy crowd of Richwoods students enters the cafeteria. They grab Wee John Lad by the legs and swing him around and around, eventually dropping him back at the table with the other students."
Wee John Lad,*Exasperated*,And now I’m dizzy!
Manos,*Jokingly*,Looks like we should call you “Whee” John Lad!
Arnolda,N/A,"Oh, Manos! Don’t worry, Wee John Lad, everything will be okay. I hadn’t realized you felt so distant from us. Maybe we can try getting to know each other better. Feel like sharing some of your interests?"
Wee John Lad,N/A,"Well, I’m a child, so cartoons, I guess. And I sure am getting attracted to the animated characters I watch every day!"
Manos,N/A,"Well, if that’s the case, have you heard of hentai?"
Wee John Lad,N/A,"Even though my intellect is vast, this is a topic I know nothing about."
Narrator,N/A,The students hear the cafeteria doors slam open. There stands their beloved professor along with the class pet Iggy the iguana.
Dr. Dongle,*Exclamation*,WAHAHAHOO!!
Bulpy,*Surprisedly*,It’s Dr. Dongle! I didn’t know we were having a field trip today.
Dr. Dongle,N/A,"That’s right, Bulpy. I heard there was someone who didn’t know about something. As a professional educator, it makes me smile when someone learns something. And I just brushed my teeth."
Wee John Lad,N/A,"Hey, Dr. Dongle! It’s true, I don’t know what that hentai stuff is."
Narrator,N/A,"Dr. Dongle gives a knowing wink to Iggy the iguana. By the way, Iggy the iguana is one of those like scary iguanas that’s all covered in spikes and long claws and shit."
Dr. Dongle,*Singsong-y*,Looks like it’s time for a FIELD TRIP
Arnolda,*Anxiously*,"Ohhhh, I hope it can be a normal field trip this time…"
Bulpy,N/A,With tha Dongmaster? No way! But I am worried that the contents of this field trip are in direct contention with my Bible class.
Wee John Lad,N/A,Oh boy! My first official field trip. I’ve only heard about all the fun up till now!
Arnolda,N/A,I much prefer the field trips at Peoria Secular School
Dr. Dongle,N/A,No use resisting now! Education is afoot! All aboard!
Narrator,N/A,"A large anthropomorphic yellow bus crashes through the side of the cafeteria, opening its side door to let the students aboard. Wee John Lad and Manos hop on happily and Arnolda and Bulpy are forced on under threat from Iggy the iguana."
Arnolda,N/A,"Well, here we go again."
Narrator,N/A,"A whirlwind engulfs the bus and it, along with its newly boarded crew, shrinks down to only a few inches long. The bus now resembles a flash drive. It flies out of the cafeteria, to the computer lab, and into the nearest desktop USB port."
Dr. Dongle,N/A,"Class, today we are learning about hentai. Welcome to the internet!"
Wee John Lad,N/A,But I already know about that! It’s called the world-wide web.
Dr. Dongle,N/A,"Yes, yes, but it seems you haven’t learned everything just yet."
Narrator,N/A,"The bus flies through a cable and transistor world, dodging bytes and bits alike. The students are blinded by several bright flashes before sudden darkness. They feel the bus decelerate, then come to a halt, clearly having reached its destination."
Dr. Dongle,*As a revelation*,"Behold, class… the world of Deviantart!"
Narrator,N/A,"The students file off the bus in the dark. Their senses are soon attacked by a litany of cartoon characters in various stages of undress and fetishistic predicaments to the furthest extent that they can see, hear, and smell."
Manos,*Jokingly*,More like Lenient Art! Everyone who posts here has no standards.
Wee John Lad,N/A,"Good one, Manos! I’d have to agree, although I’m just now learning about this place."
Arnolda,N/A,"I guess this place doesn’t seem so bad, actually. Nothing too wacky yet."
Bulpy,*to himself*,"The sin levels are growing, soon they will be off the charts"
Narrator,N/A,The students’ field of vision is now overflowing with such sexy sights.
Wee John Lad,*nearly climaxing*,"This is exhilarating! By my calculations, there are as many sexy pictures of Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron here as there are stars in our universe."
Bulpy,*addressing Manos on the side*,"Hey, Manos, this is getting out of hand. Dr. Dongle is causing us to sin."
Manos,*to Bulpy*,"I’m with you, Bulpy! Maybe we can get everyone back on the bus and get out of here."
Dr. Dongle,*Commandingly*,Did I hear “back to the bus?” Let’s go! I still have quite the treat for you all.
Narrator,N/A,The students once again follow Dr. Dongle and file onto the bus
Dr. Dongle,*Singsong-y*,"Seatbelts, everyone!"
Narrator,N/A,The students barely have any time to strap themselves in before the bus launches off again. They are hurtling at great speed towards the sexy images.
Dr. Dongle,*Gallantly*,"Hold on to your butts, class! We’re going straight to the source. FOR KNOWLEDGE!"
Narrator,N/A,"The bus has acquired its target, a rather inflated version of the donkey from Shrek. The bus flies directly into the donkey’s mouth and down his gullet."
Manos,N/A,I guess you could say we’re really in the belly of the beast now!
Dr. Dongle,N/A,"That’s right, Manos! We are in a highly concentrated area of hentai now. There’s no better place for Wee John Lad to learn. The bus is equipped with sophisticated sensors that pick up everything he’ll need to know about hentai."
Narrator,N/A,Several television screens spring from the side walls of the bus. The students flock to them to learn.
Arnolda,*Excitedly*,"Wee John Lad, check this one out! The Spongebob on this screen has massive gazongas!"
Wee John Lad,N/A,"According to my research, comically oversized mammaries are common motifs within hentai"
Bulpy,*In a rage*,This detector has the sin levels off the charts!
Manos,N/A,They’re over 9000!!
Narrator,*to Manos*,"Nice hentai reference, Manos."
Manos,*to the Narrator*,"Thank you, narrator."
Bulpy,*In a rage*,I can’t take this anymore! We have to get out of here!
Dr. Dongle,N/A,"Great idea, Bulpy!"
Narrator,N/A,"Dr. Dongle pushes a big red button next to the steering wheel of the bus, launching the students from the fuselage of the bus. Upon ejecting, the students are automatically suited up in little diver suits like in Fantastic Voyage (1966). Said students slowly spin to a stop, now engulfed in the intestines inside Inflated Donkey from Shrek."
Manos,N/A,I guess you could say we’re really really in the belly of the beast now!
Arnolda,N/A,"You said it, Manos! We never plunged the depths of Dreamworks IP at Peoria Secular School."
Bulpy,*Alarmingly*,"Ahh, look out!"
Narrator,N/A,"The students narrowly dodge a hentai meteor that hurtles past them. By the way, Bulpy’s Fantastic Voyage suit has a big “B” on it."
Manos,*Shouting to Bulpy*,Bulpy! Your plan! You’ve got to do something to stop the field trip in its tracks!
Wee John Lad,N/A,"By my calculations, there’s no need to do anything rash."
Bulpy,*At a fever pitch*,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! I have had it with these Monkey-Fighting sins on this Monday to Friday Bus!
Narrator,N/A,"Bulpy, now blinded in a sin-induced rage, grasps his helmet."
Arnolda,*Shouting to Bulpy*,"Bulpy, NO!"
Bulpy,*fed up*,We need to go home! Here’s what will happen to you all if you just stay here with your hentai!!
Narrator,N/A,"Bulpy removes his Fantastic Voyage helmet, with the big “B” on it, exposing him to the ambient cosmic cringe rays, paralyzing him with pleasure in a permanent ahegao expression."
Manos,*Jokingly*,Looks like Bulpy’s been ran through!
Wee John Lad,N/A,"You said it, Manos!"
Arnolda,*Alarmed*,"Guys, we’ve got to get back out of the computer right now to save Bulpy!"
Narrator,N/A,The three collegemates rush their fossilized friend back aboard the bus to confront Dr. Dongle.
Wee John Lad,*To Dr. Dongle*,"According to my research, Bulpy cannot last much longer in this state. He needs to return to the outside world and receive some sort of medical attention."
Dr. Dongle,N/A,"Right you are, Wee John Lad. Our work here is finished, you now know about hentai."
Wee John Lad,*Confidently*,That’s right!
Narrator,N/A,"The bus shoots off, straight out of the computer’s monitor. We cut to a few weeks later. The gang is now visiting Bulpy in his room at one of those bigass Peoria hospitals. Wee John Lad has brought flowers."
Wee John Lad,*handing Bulpy flowers*,"Here ya go, Bulpy. How are you feeling today?"
Bulpy,N/A,"Not so bad anymore, yeah, not so bad anymore. When I was in that hentai induced coma, I never thought I would get out, I thought I’d be stuck there in the pleasure pit forever. But you three saved me. You’re my real pals."
Arnolda,*jokingly*,Going to the pleasure pit forever is what we called getting expelled at Peoria Secular School.
Manos,N/A,"Nice one, Arnolda!"
Narrator,N/A,"The students, now true friends, embrace in a mega hug. They’ve become bonded forever, like the pages of a salacious manga. And now Wee John Lad knows what that means. THE END"
