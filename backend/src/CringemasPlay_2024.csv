Narrator,*dreamily*,"Begin Act I. We see an island. It is Peoria Island. Home to a young boy named Pupa and his friend Broccolo Bernardi. On any given day you can find them playing together on the beach, but today Pupa finds himself floating high above the island. He spots Broccolo Bernardi waving to him on the beach. Pupa wants to go to him. He leans forward, moving slowly at first but then accelerating further down … down. Like a comet now he plunges from the sky. Broccolo is shouting. Pupa crashes into the water, a good ways off from the beach. He sinks deeper and deeper into an abyss. He realizes he can breathe. He soon comes to rest on a pedestal. He is far from Peoria Island but still feels at home, almost like he is within himself, way deep down in his soul. He sees a cloaked man across from him on the pedestal. The man extends his arm and Pupa sees a green hand jutting from the sleeve. Is he beckoning Pupa to leave his island behind?"
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,Pupa! Wake up! You were sleeping and it sounded like you were having a dream. Is everything ok?
Pupa,N/A,"Huh? What? Oh! I’m awake! … No, I’m all right now … I just keep having these weird dreams … Anyway, what are we doing today?"
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"We were just on our way to the public address from the mayor of Peoria Island, Jim Ardis!"
Pupa,N/A,"Ah, right. Well, let’s get a move on."
Narrator,N/A,Pupa and Broccolo Bernardi run down the road hand in hand toward a crowd of locals waiting for the mayor to begin his public address. They assimilate into the crowd just as the mayor begins speaking.
Jim Ardis,*as a pronouncement*,Our island must remain free of Cringe! Cringe has completely overtaken the neighboring islands!
Pupa,*to Broccolo at his side*,"Broccolo, do you ever feel like you can feel the cringe that exists way deep down in your soul, no matter how repressed it is?"
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"Yes, Pupa. I think we all do have a small bit of cringe way deep down in each of our souls."
Pupa,N/A,I would never embrace my own cringe way deep down in my soul. It’s taken over the neighboring islands! What do you think it would do to someone who completely relinquishes to the cringe?
Jim Ardis,N/A,"Stop talking during my public address! … In order to combat the encroaching cringe menace, I have worked with our scientific specialists to develop a weapon. Behold, the cop bomb!"
Narrator,N/A,"Mayor Jim Ardis steps to the side, revealing a bomb behind him. The bomb is about the size of a small manatee."
Pupa,*Surprised*,"A bomb!? But Broccolo, won’t that kill us too even if we aren’t cringe?"
Broccolo Bernardi,*Off-handedly*,"Shut up, Pupa! I’m trying to listen to the rest of the public address."
Shrek,"*In disguise, blending in with the crowd*","Hey, you, kid! We gotta get out of here, that thing’s about to go off!"
Pupa,Surprised,What? Hey! You’re that guy from my dream!
Shrek,Hurriedly,"No time to catch up, you need to hop in my mouth, quick!"
Narrator,N/A,"The strange man from the crowd pulls back his hood to reveal he is none other than Shrek, his mouth agape, ready and waiting for Pupa to take the plunge. Pupa is reticent to obey, but soon has no choice as Jim Ardis pulls the pin on the cop bomb leading to a violent cringe-searing explosion. Pupa is knocked unconscious by the blast, which hurtles him into Shrek’s mouth…"
Narrator,N/A,Thus begins Act II
Shrek,N/A,"Hey, wake up little guy!"
Pupa,N/A,Huh? What? Where are we? Did you eat me?
Shrek,laughingly,"Ha, no! You jumped into a portal to this world, your home world was destroyed by that bomb."
Pupa,N/A,So you don’t know where we are?
Shrek,N/A,"I didn’t have a chance to focus where we were going, I just knew we had to get out of there. I had to save you because you are the chosen hero who must embrace the cringe way deep down in your soul."
Pupa,N/A,As if! I will never embrace my own cringe way deep down in my soul.
Shrek,N/A,"You may think so, but the cringe works in mysterious ways. Hey, there’s someone we could ask them where we are!"
Narrator,N/A,Shrek and Pupa jog over to the man they spotted. He is accompanied by a kid and is holding a long box.
Shrek,N/A,"Excuse me, sir, can you tell us where we are?"
That Sodding Gamer,*Holding katana in a box*,This is the Hanwei Forge Elite Katana this is the unveiling I am opening it
Pupa,N/A,"Wow, these guys are cringe royale, but okay I guess…"
That Sodding Gamer,"*to everyone, while miming unboxing the katana*","See, another smaller box within the larger box. This katana was 209 dollars US and about 135 Canadian after conversion at the time. I had to pay about 124 dollars for customs fees. It’s supposed to be very sharp"
Tyler,*whistling loudly*,*whistles loudly*
That Sodding Gamer,*Sternly*,Shh! Tyler! It will sound really weird on the video
Narrator,*to That Sodding Gamer*,You have to cut the plastic a little bit. It’s got a bit of plastic it’s got it all over -
Tyler,*to the Narrator*,It’s Tape – IT’S TAPE
That Sodding Gamer,*to Tyler*,"Yeah there’s tape on it, I try to be a bit careful don’t want it to -"
Narrator,*to That Sodding Gamer*,"Yes, because you never have to know if you need to send it back"
That Sodding Gamer,*to the Narrator*,It has more to do with the fact that I don’t want to damage anything.
That Sodding Gamer,*taking katana out of box*,"Ah, as you can see, the katana itself is wrapped."
Tyler,*Excitedly*,"Wow, it looks like an ambrella now."
That Sodding Gamer,*to Shrek and Pupa*,This is actually my first katana
Tyler,N/A,Watch it! Whoaa oh my gosh that’s shiny!
That Sodding Gamer,N/A,"That’s just the sheath, you can see that there’s a taeg on it in various languages. I’ll be taking that off."
Tyler,N/A,Wow woah okay
Narrator,N/A,"Very nice, eh"
That Sodding Gamer,*pulling sword out of sheath*,Well it certainly does look very sharp doesn’t it
Narrator,N/A,The Hanwei Forge Elite Katana suddenly glows and shines a beam of light directly at Pupa.
Shrek,N/A,"Pupa! That sword is reacting to the cringe way deep down in your soul! See, you are the chosen hero!"
Pupa,N/A,No! I refuse to accept the cringe and bear the sword!
Shrek,N/A,You must! It is your destiny!
Narrator,N/A,"As Shrek and Pupa continue their arguing, the Hanwei Forge Elite Katana suddenly flies from the hands of That Sodding Gamer, over Tyler’s head, and into Pupa’s hands. Pupa can feel that the sword will not accept any other master."
Pupa,N/A,Crap! Guess I’m stuck with bearing this sword… but I will still not accept the cringe.
That Sodding Gamer,N/A,"Hey, you! Boy! You have stolen my Hanwei Forge Elite Katana and I will have you tried before the highest court in this land. To the King!"
Narrator,N/A,Tyler and That Sodding Gamer have captured Shrek and Pupa for the alleged crime of theft. They have been brought to the highest court in the land before the King.
King Curtis,*regally*,You stand before King Curtis! What crime has been committed?
Tyler,*as an interjection*,It’s TAPE!
That Sodding Gamer,N/A,"Shh, Tyler! My liege, this boy has stolen a brand new Hanwei Forge Elite Katana right after I unboxed it"
Shrek,N/A,"Your Highness, it was out of Pupa’s control! He is the chosen one meant to wield this cringe-blade, it will serve no other master."
King Curtis,N/A,"I see. Well, let’s hear from the boy himself. What do you have to say for yourself?"
Pupa,N/A,"Well, you see, your majesty, it is just as Shrek has described. I can feel this cringe-blade bonded to the cringe way deep down in my soul. I don’t have anything else in the world, I just escaped the destruction of my home and I do not know the fate of my family. I guess cringe is the only thing I have left…"
King Curtis,N/A,"I take pity on you boy, I also have little family. In fact, all I have is chicken nuggets. Chicken nuggets is just like my family."
Pupa,*dejectedly*,"Huh? I hadn’t thought of it like that. I guess, for me … Cringe is just like my family."
Narrator,N/A,The cringe-blade glows as it did when it chose Pupa as its master.
Shrek,*Commending Pupa*,Pupa! You did it! You have truly bonded to the cringe-blade and can wield it as its master! … I sense our work is done here. We must be moving to another world.
Pupa,*Hopeful*,"Huh, “Cringe is just like my family.” It’s true! Shrek, you’ve helped me escape my sure destruction by the hands of Jim Ardis, and you’ve been right about everything so far. So, I guess it’s best if I continue to follow you."
Shrek,*opening mouth*,"Okay, well, hop in then, we must be off!"
Narrator,N/A,Thus begins Act III
Pupa,*coming to after teleporting*,Whuh … where are we?
Shrek,N/A,No clue little guy
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"Hey, Pupa! You’re alive!"
Pupa,N/A,"Huh, Broccolo!? You’re alive! I can’t believe you made it! I only survived thanks to my new friend Shrek."
Shrek,N/A,"Hi, Broccolo. I’m glad you’re okay. Do you know where we are?"
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"Oh, yeah… We’re in Grace Presbyterian Church. See, after Jim Ardis detonated that bomb, I lost consciousness and eventually woke up here. They’ve taken me in as one of their own."
Pupa,N/A,Wow! That’s great! How is it here?
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"They are doing things with cringe beyond your wildest dreams. They have harnessed the dark side of cringe, here watch…"
Narrator,N/A,Broccolo Bernardi directs their attention to a man in a lab coat. It is Dr. James Dobson. He is surrounded by beakers.
Dr. James Dobson,N/A,"Hi, kids, today we are going to perform a science experiment that shows us that Jesus is the light of the world who takes away our sins"
Narrator,N/A,Dr. James Dobson proceeds to put black liquid in a dish and then puts a candle in the middle of the same dish and lights it. He is quoting from the Bible nonstop. Dr. James Dobson covers the lit candle in the dish with a glass vase.
Pupa,*to Broccolo Bernardi*,"But, Broccolo, this isn’t the right way to connect with the cringe way deep down in your soul. Look, I have bonded with this cringe-blade-"
Broccolo Bernardi,stunned,What?! Dr. James Dobson has taught me to watch for the heathen wielding the katana infused with cringe. It is you who is not using cringe properly! Cringe is hateful!
Narrator,N/A,"Upon uttering these words, Broccolo Bernardi’s appearance immediately changes. He is now wearing an evil garment and holds an evil version of the cringe-blade."
Shrek,N/A,"Pupa, look out! Your friend has turned to the dark side of cringe!"
Dr. James Dobson,N/A,"… when we believe in Jesus, we know he has taken away our sins. Jesus is the light of the world. Let’s pray."
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"No, let’s FIGHT!"
Pupa,N/A,No! Where is the Broccolo Bernardi who was my friend?
Shrek,N/A,"I’m not sure how much more we can do here, Pupa, it seems this world has been lost to the dark side of cringe."
Pupa,N/A,I think you’re right. We gotta get out of here!
Narrator,N/A,Pupa leaps forward into Shrek’s open maw. They both immediately disappear.
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,Coward!
Narrator,N/A,Thus begins Act IV. Our protagonists find themselves after their hurried escape floating aimlessly in a dark void.
Pupa,N/A,"Shrek, how long do you think we’ve been here?"
Shrek,N/A,"Hard to say, we’re out in the deep cringe now. But wait, what’s that coming near?"
Narrator,N/A,A gargantuan inflated aardvark approaches them.
Inflation Arthur,N/A,Hey! What a wonderful kind of day!
Pupa,N/A,Wow! It’s Arthur! But why is he so rotund?
Shrek,N/A,"You don’t wanna know, little guy."
Inflation Arthur,N/A,"Hi, I’m Inflation Arthur, welcome to the land of DeviantArt. Oh, here comes my friend Spirit, too."
Sexy Spirit,*whinnying while talking*,"Hello newcomers, I am Sexy Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. Please you will notice my chiseled horse body and nipples."
Shrek,N/A,"Wow, that is oh so sexy. Do you have any more sexy friends?"
Shadow the Hedgehog,*sultrily*,"Hello there, Mr. Ogre. I am known as Shadow the Hedgehog."
Narrator,N/A,"Shrek feels something he has never felt before, at least not as intensely as he is feeling now. Waves of love crash into him. He is completely infatuated with this edgy hedgehog."
Shrek,*bursting with desire*,Awooooogah!
Pupa,N/A,"Hey, Shrek, what’s going on, we have a job to do! The cringe-blade, remember?"
Shrek,N/A,"I know, Pupa, but for once in my life now I finally feel like I belong, here on DeviantArt! You’re going to have to go through the rest without me."
Shadow the Hedgehog,*sultrily*,"Get ogre here, Shrek!"
Narrator,N/A,"Shrek does not hesitate to run off with Shadow, leaving Pupa alone"
Pupa,N/A,Oh no! Now I’m all alone. And I don’t know what to do next.
Sexy Spirit,N/A,"That’s not true, you’ve still got me!"
Inflation Arthur,N/A,"And me! I know it’s hard losing your best friend Shrek, but look on the bright side. Haven’t you at least learned something about cringe here in DeviantArt land?"
Pupa,N/A,"I guess you’re right. Back with those katana guys and the King, I learned that cringe is just like my family. Here is so different … it seems like cringe is … uh, cringe is …"
Sexy Spirit,N/A,Oh so sexy!
Pupa,N/A,"Yeah! You’re right, it was powerful enough to pull even Shrek under it’s spell. Cringe is oh so sexy!"
Narrator,N/A,The cringe-blade once again glows with a blinding light. The tip of the blade casts a beam seemingly pointing back in the direction of Peoria Island
Pupa,N/A,Huh? What’s this?
Inflation Arthur,N/A,It looks like the cringe blade powered up again and is pointing somewhere. But where?
Pupa,N/A,It’s pointing back where we came from … back to Peoria Island.
Sexy Spirit,N/A,It seems like you should go back there – is the power in your katana?
Pupa,N/A,"Yes, I feel it. I don’t know why, but I need to go back. Cringe-blade, take me back to Peoria Island!"
Narrator,N/A,"Thus begins Act V. The cringe-blade obeys Pupa’s command. He is suddenly back at Peoria Island, but the island was destroyed in the wake of the bomb. Pupa can see no one. Pupa has returned to his home, dark and desolate."
Pupa,N/A,"Man, where is everybody?"
Broccolo Bernardi,*menacingly*,"Well, well, well, looks like we’re the only ones left - just the cringe hero of legend and his old friend, Broccolo Bernardi."
Pupa,N/A,Broccolo! No! You still can’t be taken by the dark side of cringe!
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"I’m afraid that’s still the case. And it is my duty to eradicate ones like you, those who dare to defy the dark side of cringe! Cringe is hateful!"
Narrator,N/A,"A wave of dark energy pulses forth from Broccolo and the dark cringe-blade. Unlike before, Pupa holds steadfast."
Pupa,N/A,No! Cringe is just like my family!
Narrator,N/A,Pupa matches the power of Broccolo Bernardi and the wave of dark energy dissipates.
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,What? You have mastered the art of cringe? This will be tougher than I first thought. CRINGE. IS. HATEFUL.
Narrator,N/A,"Broccolo Bernardi lunges at Pupa with his dark cringe-blade, but is parried by Pupa. They continue to trade blows."
Pupa,*trading sword blows with Broccolo Bernardi*,No! Cringe is just like my family! Cringe is oh so sexy!
Broccolo Bernardi,*trading sword blows with Pupa*,Cringe is hateful!!
Pupa,*trading sword blows with Broccolo Bernardi*,Cringe is oh so sexy! Cringe is just like my family!
Narrator,N/A,"The two continue, locked in combat. Suddenly, Pupa hears the friends he met on his adventure, chanting along with him. They are amplifying his own chants in unison with him. Cringe is just like my family! Cringe is oh so sexy!"
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,Huh? What’s going on? Who are all these other people saying the same things as you? You can’t seriously think this will defeat the dark side of cringe.
Pupa,N/A,No! I know it will defeat the dark side of cringe! CRINGE. IS. JUST. LIKE. MY. FAMILY. CRINGE. IS. OH. SO. SEXY.
Narrator,N/A,"The chanting power of Pupa’s friends pours into the cringe-blade he wields, charging it for a final strike. Pupa does not hesitate to strike down his friend. He knows what must be done. He has truly relinquished himself to the cringe deep down in his soul. His blade of light purges the darkness from Broccolo Bernardi. In the wake of the attack, Broccolo is left crumpled on the ground. Pupa rushes to him."
Broccolo Bernardi,N/A,"Ow, everything hurts so much. Huh, Pupa? Is that you?"
Pupa,N/A,Broccolo! You’re back to being the good old Broccolo Bernardi who was my friend! You no longer belong to the dark side of cringe!
Broccolo Bernardi,*hopeful*,"That’s right, Pupa. My dark side of cringe has been defeated. But it looks like we have a lot to do to rebuild Peoria Island. What do you say we work together to rebuild?"
Pupa,N/A,"Sounds good, old friend. Sounds good."
Narrator,N/A,"They walk off together, hand in hand, ready to rebuild their island home together, including Broccolo’s old restaurant. They walk away as friends now embracing the cringe way deep down in their souls. THE END"
